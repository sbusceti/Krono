## 🚀 Simple & Minimalist Task Tracker in Kotlin & Compose Multiplatform

This is a **Kotlin Multiplatform** project targeting **Android, iOS, and Desktop (JVM)**.

---

### ✨ Project Scope and Goals

The primary goal of this application is to provide a **very simple and minimal tool for tracking the time dedicated to each task (Time Tracking)**.

Concurrently, the project serves as a **"side project"** to offer a **solid base and a practical example** of a well-architected application using **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** and **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)**.

### 🛠️ Architecture and Technology Stack

The project demonstrates the use of a **modern and robust stack** for KMP/CMP development, implementing the following tools and patterns:

#### 💻 Core Technologies

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for shared and platform-specific logic.
* **Compose Multiplatform (CMP):** Used to build a **single, declarative, and reactive user interface** across all target platforms.
* **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP):** Enables **code sharing** of the business logic, data layer, and ViewModels between Android, iOS, and Desktop.

#### ⚙️ Data & State Management

* **MVI (Model-View-Intent) Pattern:** The architecture adopted for reactive and unidirectional state management.
* **Coroutines & Flow:** Used for asynchronous operation management and reactive data propagation.
* **Koin:** The dependency injection (DI) framework for modular and scalable component management.
* **Room:** For local data persistence.
